1. This application provides users with the ability to select rental cars. Users
   can navigate to the catalog page where they can filter cars based on specific
   criteria and add them to favorites or remove them if needed.

2. The project was developed using the following tech stack: React, Redux, API
   libraries, styled-components, nanoid, and Axios.

3. On the first page of the catalog, 8 listings are initially rendered, and the
   rest can be loaded by clicking the "Load more" button.

4. When the page is refreshed, the final user actions are preserved. In other
   words, if a user adds a listing to their favorites and then refreshes the
   page, the button will still be in the "favorite listing" state with the
   corresponding color.
